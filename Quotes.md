| There are many things to be done, but means are wanting in this country [India]. We have brains but no hands. We have the doctrine of Vedanta, but we have not the power to put it into practice. In our books there is the doctrine of universal equality, but in work we make great distinctions. It was in India that unselfish and disinterested work of the most exalted type was preached, but in practice we are awfully cruel, awfully heartless--unable to think of anything besides our own mass-of-flesh bodies. | Vivekananda |

| When I was a boy, I became a sceptic, and it seemed for a time as if I must give up all hope of religion.

It appealed to me this way. | Vivekananda |
| We generally find people holding two opinions regarding the world. Some are pessimists and say, "How horrible this world is, how wicked!" Some others are optimists and say, "How beautiful this world is, how wonderful!" <br />To those who have not controlled their own minds, the world is either full of evil or at best a mixture of good and evil. This very world will become to them an optimist world when they become masters of their own minds. Nothing then will work upon them as good or evil. They will find everything to be in its proper place, to be harmonious. | Vivekananda |
| The person who has practiced control over himself cannot be acted upon by anything outside. There is no more slavery for him. His mind has become free. Such a person alone is fit to live well in the world. | Vivekananda |
| It is a very hard thing to understand, but you will come to learn in time that nothing in the universe has power over you until you allow it to exercise such a power. Nothing has power over the Self, until the Self becomes a fool and loses independence. | Vivekananda |
| All that a man achieves and that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts. |  |
| My advice to you is not to inquire why or whither, but just to enjoy your ice cream while it's on your plate. |  |
| Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up. | Thomas Edison |
| A Smile is a language everybody understands. It costs nothing but creates much. |  |
| Be sure there is a problem in the first place before working hard to solve. |  |
| Sow an act and reap a habit, Sow a habit and reap a character, Sow a character and reap a destiny. |  |
| Stop talking before people stop listening. |  |
